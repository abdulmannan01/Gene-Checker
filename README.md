# Gene-Checker

ATGC are the four nitrogenous bases that comprises the Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA). DNA is a herdity material which carries the traits or characteriatics from parents to offspring, where   
● A stands for Adenine  
● T stands for Thyime  
● G stands for Guanine  
● C stands for Cytosine

This is a Software Development project on gene sequence, takes input from a fasta file, which gives the following results:  
● Information about the gene sequence  
● The actual gene sequence  
● Count of Adenine (A)  
● Count of Thymine (T)  
● Count of Guanine (G)  
● Count of Cytosine (C)  
● Length of each line of sequence  
● Fraction of Guanine and Cytosine (G + C) count in each sequence line  
● Location of the gene sequence  
● Strand ( + or - )  
● Process ID   
● Geneshort  
● Synonym  
● Code  
● COG  
● Product  
● Protein sequence  
● Number of codons  

FASTA format is a text-based format for representing either nucleotide sequences or peptide sequences, in which base pairs or amino acids are represented using single-letter codes. A sequence in FASTA format begins with a single-line description, followed by lines of sequence data. The description line is distinguished from the sequence data by a greater-than (">") symbol in the first column. It is recommended that all lines of text be shorter than 80 characters in length.

Requirements :  
● Fasta file  
● Python 3.7  
● XAMPP for MySQL Database in PHPmyadmin localhost
